		<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>
			Hello.  My name is Alex and welcome to my website.  I recently graduated from Colorado School of Mines with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science on May 9, 2014.  I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and work with the latest technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I am busy working on developing a couple Android apps, and I am collaborating with two old classmates on developing a website where we will write reviews for all sorts of things.  I am also slowly working on writing a book which will be awesome, and it has been really fun to write.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really enjoy all sorts of games but much prefer multiplayer ones.  Recently, my friends and I have recently become super interested in playing various board games.  Games are great fun, especially when alliances break down and secret pacts are formed.
